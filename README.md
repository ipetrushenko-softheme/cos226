# COS 226
Programming assignments for the Princeton course COS 226.

1. Percolation.
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? 

2. Queues.
The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using resizing arrays and linked lists.

3. Autocomplete.
Write a program to implement autocomplete for a given set of n terms, where a term is a query string and an associated non-negative weight. That is, given a prefix, find all queries that start with the given prefix, in descending order of weight.

4. 8puzzle.
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible.

5. KD-trees.
Implement the kd-tree data structre. Create a symbol-table data type whose keys are two-dimensional points. Use a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects and computer animation to speeding up neural networks and data mining.

6. WordNet digraph. 
Build the WordNet digraph and implement LCA.

7. Seam-Carving.
Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image.

8. Burrowsâ€“Wheeler data compression algorithm.
This revolutionary algorithm outcompresses gzip and PKZIP, is relatively easy to implement, and is not protected by any patents. It forms the basis of the Unix compression utility bzip2.
