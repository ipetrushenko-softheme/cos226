# COS 226
Programming assignments for the Princeton course COS 226.

1. Percolation.
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? 

2. Queues.
The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using resizing arrays and linked lists.

3. Autocomplete.
